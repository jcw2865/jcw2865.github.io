            <p class="box" id="box-3">
                My background is in operations and project management. For the past five years I have worked with both
                large organizations such as the United States Army as well as burgeoning tech start-ups. I am now looking
                to bring my operational skills to the field of web development and help organizations achieve their
                goals with efficiency and reliability.

            <!--Contents of "About Me" section-->
            <p class="box" id="box-4">
                I have been married to my beautiful wife, Natalie, since May 18th, 2019, and we have a three year old
                Jack-Russel/Shi-Tsu mix named Scoots. I love doing all sorts of things, but I especially enjoy spending time with
                friends and family, being active, and experimenting in the kitchen. All of that being said, I really do find joy in most
                things and am always eager to learn something new and try something for the first time.
